          The secure server software (SSL) that processes Peace Corps donations is
          the industry standard and among the best software available today for
          secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal data
          including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be
          read as the information travels over the Internet. You can tell when you
          are protected by encryption â€” the lock or key at the bottom of your
          browser changes color or is no longer broken.
