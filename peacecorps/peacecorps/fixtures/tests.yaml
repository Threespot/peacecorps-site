      volunteers and people of Malawi by contributions to the Malawi Country Fund,
      which is designed for faster response to the Volunteers and their communities.
      An example of country fund use was funding a local mini-camp for a Volunteer''s
      community, using resources and people that were trained at one of the national
      camps, like Camp GLOW or Camp Sky. These can happen frequently as $300 - $800

    description: '{"data": [{"type": "text", "data": {"text": "<p>Students at the
      agricultural secondary school, spend their days accumulating knowledge and practice
      time with books and a variety of agricultural techniques. However, they have
      very little opportunity to connect with places that are not their own or to
      research beyond their experiences. This project aims to transform one of the
      classrooms into a well-equipped, permanent computer lab containing 10 computers
      with internet access, a photocopy machine, and a printer. Students will be able
      to use this computer lab to receive adequate hands-on exposure to practice the
      material they are learning. Through the improved classes, students will be able
      to hone their skills with common programs such as Microsoft Word, Excel, and
      Power Point, among others. They will also learn how to navigate using the internet
      in order to conduct research, communicate with others, and gain a much broader
      view of the world. The computer lab will be operational year-round; open to
      students after normal classroom hours and to the general public during weekends
      and school breaks. In addition, free or low-cost training will be available
      to students unable to continue their studies and peoples of low income. This
      project will be realized and sustained through a partnership between the group
      STG Informatique and the school administration. STG Informatique will help equip
      the computer lab with necessary accommodations such as ceiling fans, networking
      cables, internet router, etc., and they will oversee the functionality of the
      lab throughout the year. The school administration will reserve a portion of
      its annual budget to provide for the overall maintenance and upkeep of the computer
      lab, and it will create a new, full-time employment for a computer lab assistant.
      In addition to this, profits from computer lab services such as photocopies,
      printed documents, and navigation time will go towards the growth of the computer
      lab, as well as towards additional campus development projects. Donations to
      this project will help provide the students with the proper means to develop
      their computer skills, and will go directly towards the purchase of the computers,
      photocopy machine, and printer of the new computer lab.</p>"}}]}'

    description: '{"data": [{"type": "text", "data": {"text": "<p>The smallest country
      in Africa, The Gambia, is a young developing nation with a high percentage of
      its population under the age of 14. Currently, the official rate of HIV/AIDS
      remains relatively low in comparison to other sub-Saharan countries. However,
      The Gambia possesses several high risk factors which make the nation vulnerable
      to increased rates of infection; these include an active transnational shipping
      route, active sex trade, little or no sex education in the classroom along with
      high levels of illiteracy, access to media in general, and polygamy. In order
      to combat these risk factors and rising rates of infection, Peace Corps partnered
      with National Aids Secretariat (NAS) and a Gambian association in 2010 for the
      first HIV Bike Trek. Due to success and impact of HIV Bike Trek 2010, Peace
      Corps Volunteers organized subsequent HIV Bike Treks in 2011, 2012, and 2013,
      and is now organizing a trek for 2014.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The ultimate goals of
      HIV Bike Trek are: to educate and empower 808 Gambian youths with the knowledge
      and confidence to protect themselves and their loved ones from HIV. The Trek
      entails PCVs and Gambian counterparts biking across West Coast Region and Lower
      River Region, to four Upper Basic Schools to teach Grade 8 or 9 students about
      HIV/AIDS. Through a two-day intensive training, the students will learn about
      the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS and the life skills to promote speaking out and
      combating stigma and discrimination. By educating Gambian youths about HIV/AIDS
      before they become sexual active, this project hopes to reduce new infections
      rates and prevent HIV/AIDS from becoming a national epidemic.</p>"}}]}'

      a multi-purpose court. Previously, the community and primary school relied on
      a a small green field and a hard court at the high school for sports and recreation.
      Now with the new multi-purpose court, another more functional area is available
      for more of the community''s residents and youth to participate in recreational
      activities. However, in constructing the court, retaining walls were built from
      the ground on three sides, to create a level plane, but also created an unsafe
      precipice. The community has not been able to completely maximize the use of
      the court, for fear of safety for the children, and the possibility of balls/equipment
      falling over. This project proposal will fund the erection of a perimeter fence
      around the multi-purpose court to keep the participants and equipment within
      the court boundaries. The community''s aim is to create a safe recreational
      area for students and community members to develop healthy lifestyle choices
      through sports. A fence will allow for increased access to the court, resulting
      in positive community relationships and sportsmanship through recreational activity.
      The beneficiaries are the school students, community sports teams (netball,
      basketball) and the community members who are interested in recreational play.

      education is not mandatory in Botswana. Students who have parents who can afford
      school fees usually have the opportunity to attend pre-schools. Orphans and
      vulnerable children (OVC''s) and destitute children often do not have the opportunity
      to attend pre-school, which is often needed by these children. OVC''s and destitute
      children often start behind their peers in education. About 30% of my community''s
      population is OVC and destitute children.  From the support of the Village Development
      Committee in my village, we chose a vacant building to renovate and transform
      into an established pre-school by August 2014 that will offer affordable education
      for the destitute children, special needs children, and orphans.  From recent
      relocation of minority tribes, a high number of destitute and orphans live in
      my village. Almost over 75% of students who are OVC''s and destitute suffer
      from malnutrition, poor housing environments, lack of educational knowledge,
      and low language literacy of Setswana and English. Setso''s (Culture) Pre-school
      aims to: provide affordable and quality education to orphans and destitute children,
      prepare children towards a pre-primary education with an emphasis on English
      education, and teach critical developmental life skills to shape a new generation
      of optimistic learners. Additionally our goal is to have at least 30 villagers
      impacted with knowledge of grant writing, child development education, pre-school
      teacher training, business operation skills, and negotiating and entrepreneurial
      skills by August 2014 in order to maintain sustainability of Setso''s Pre-School

      will construct a School Sports Education and Recreation Center for the local
      high school. The objective of our School Sports Education and Recreation Center
      is to have a space at the school for sports as well as Physical Education and
      Health exercise programs. The school director has begun organizing the teachers
      that will be involved in the athletic education program. The athletic education
      program will teach girls and boys new sports, exercises, ways to stay healthy
      and develop team building skills. The court will serve as a basketball court,
      volleyball court, and a soccer court among other games and activities.  The
      deputy director coaches both a volleyball and soccer team. Once the court is
      built the school deputy wants to develop his knowledge and skills in basketball
      so he will be able to start possibly coaching a girls and boys basketball team.
      Girl students showed a high interest in wanting a court to learn and play sports,
      so the court will be a safe space to promote women''s sports. Sports education
      is important for students because it improves overall health of the student
      body and helps create involvement in sports and competitions. I will be teaching
      a health education class this upcoming year. In my health class I will teach
      students about the health benefits of sports. The school director wants the
      court to be used recreationally by his students at the high school and secondary
      school as well an assembly area for school and community members on a regular
      basic. The school is providing the land and the students and teachers have already
      committed to helping construct the court to lower the price. However, local
      carpenters will be doing most of the work to make sure the court is strong and
      will last for a long period of time. Having a School Sports Education and Recreation
      Center will lead to an improvement of physical health throughout the student
      body. Additionally, many students will learn teamwork, leadership skills, and
      self-confidence.</p> \n\n\t\t\t<p>If you have questions about this or other

      Stoves is a community project designed to give 12 families from rural areas
      the opportunity to no longer cook over an open fire and improve the health of
      the family by decreasing respiratory diseases and infections that are caused
      by years of smoke exposure. Each participating family has a child under the
      age of 5 who has been exposed to dangerous fumes every time the family prepares
      a meal. By providing each family with an improved stove, the chances of the
      children developing an illness such as asthma, pneumonia, bronchitis, tuberculosis,
      etc. will significantly decrease. \n<br /><br />\nThe project has three implementation
      components, <br /> \n1) Search for and select families with low socio-economic
      resources who have children under the age of five and are currently cooking
      over an open fire. <br />\n2) Fund and resource each stove through the Peace
      Corps Partnership Program. <br />\n3) Provide education for each family within
      a time span of two months over relevant health topics such as nutrition, the
      importance of an improved stove, family planning, HIV/AIDS, hygiene in the kitchen,
      etc. The community has come together and is supporting the project with the
      construction of the stoves as well as by donating some materials needed for
      the construction. \n<br /><br />\nThis small community has demonstrated their
      commitment and interest in bettering the health of the families by aiding in
      the improved stoves project.</p> \n\n\t\t\t<p>If you have questions about this

      to UNICEF''s statistics in 2012, diarrheal diseases and pneumonia are among
      the leading causes of death in children under five years of age globally, accounting
      for more than two million child mortalities or one\\-fourth of all deaths of
      children under five. Approximately 90% of all these deaths are due to unsafe
      water and poor hygiene. Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world
      and only half of the population has access to safe drinking water. The water
      consumed by the population is drawn from rivers and creeks located several kilometers
      away from their homes without using proper cleaning methods. The Merina people
      of the Vakinankaratra Region of Madagascar want and need latrines and wells;
      they, however, do not have enough money to purchase the materials, with an average
      daily income of less than $1. With help from family and friends in the United
      States, we plan on building 18 latrines and 18 wells in 7 different communities
      spread across 20 kilometers.   This Total Sanitation project has four components:
      to instill behavior change methods in the local community, to provide access
      to durable latrines in the most rural areas, to provide access to water sources
      in the most rural areas, and to educate the local community on safe drinking
      water and safe disposal of feces to reduce illnesses and improve sanitation.
      The impact of this project is an improvement of water, sanitation, and a healthier
      living situation for all who live in the region.\n\n            If you have

      to USAID''s HIV Health Profile of Madagascar for 2010, the country \"has one
      of the highest rates of sexually transmitted infections (STI''s) in the world.\"
      The majority of STIs can be easily treated but if people are too afraid, intimidated,
      or embarrassed to seek treatment, it can lead to serious problems. Since many
      STIs have no symptoms at all, and because many women may not recognize if they
      have a symptom, both genders need to be extra cautious. In addition, 10 years
      ago, Madagascar was at the same prevalence of AIDS as South Africa, and we must
      continue in the effort to decrease this rate here in Madagascar. With this in
      mind, I would like to build a basketball court at my village''s middle school
      to future educate the students about the prevalence of HIV/STD in their home
      country. With a world map on HIV/STD rates of the world already displayed at
      the CEG, this basketball court will go hand in hand with the map. The basketball
      court will be used to play games such as condom races, Q&amp;A about HIV/STD,
      etc all incorporated with a game of basketball or just shooting around. Lastly,
      the students will be able to learn and participate in a new sport and hobby
      - basketball. I would like to initiate the court on December 1, 2014 - World
      Aids Day.</p> \n\n\t\t\t<p>If you have questions about this or other projects,

      are needed to provide a place for the children to exercise and play, to learn
      social interaction skills in the course of recreation and to encourage healthy
      daily exercise.  Kindergarten #1 has a total of 70 students ages 1.5 through
      7.  In the past years, the town has made many improvements to this kindergarten
      including renovations to the exterior and interior and the addition of a new
      central biomass heating plant. Still remaining to be done are improvements to
      the outdoor play area.  Kindergarten #2 is a State established preschool founded
      in 1973.  This kindergarten was developed for 120 children but currently has
      an enrollment of 140 children.  This kindergarten serves Russian speaking families.\n<br
      /><br />\nKindergarten##1 lacks any covered outdoor area to provide protection
      from the elements whether that be rain or sun.  Kindergarten #2 lacks enough
      outdoor play equipment for its larger enrollment.  These improvements will help
      fulfill the need for sufficient outdoor play areas as these two kindergartens.\n<br
      /><br />\nOutdoor play is necessary for young children to exercise, to learn
      social interaction skills in the course of recreation and to develop healthy
      daily exercise habits.  Studies have shown that young children should engage
      in at least one hour of exercise daily.  a playground is a key learning environment

      5, 2014. Our third objective is to run health education classes including hand

      objective is to increase youth volunteerism\nby getting at least ten volunteer
      to help with the hygiene education that will be given after the construction

      Camp\" for 30 at-risk youth with and without special needs. Youth will spend
      every morning participating in art, sports, and theater activities exploring
      themes of inclusion and respect. Then, campers will spend every afternoon working
      together to build their community''s first accessible playground. Building the
      playground will 1) provide youth with special needs an opportunity to present
      themselves as contributors to their community as opposed to mere recipients
      of care, 2) allow campers to apply the lessons they learned during their morning
      activities to real life, and 3) provide a safe, low-maintenance space where
      everyone, regardless of ability, is welcome to play, make friends, and continue
      to build a community of inclusion.\n<br /><br />\nCampers will also host a final
      event to share with the community what they learned and built, and a toolkit
      will be made available to all Peace Corps volunteers and their counterparts
      to encourage the creation of similar camps throughout Morocco.\n<br /><br />\nThe
      community is digging deep to pay for the camp food, staff, transportation, and
      lodging. However, they still need lots of help to pay for the playground and
      morning activities.  Your donation will directly empower youth with special

      youth to complete a seven month outdoor leadership program that incorporates
      local environmental learning excursions and leadership building activities.
      The project will culminate with the groups uniting from opposite corners of
      the country to climb the tallest mountain in North Africa. CLIMB will encourage
      Moroccan youth to analyze and contemplate their natural world critically and
      creatively, modes of thinking often under-emphasized in the Moroccan education
      system. Additionally, CLIMB will foster life skills such as self-confidence,
      teamwork, and leadership, all of which will hopefully extend to our youth''s
      future personal and professional endeavors.\n<br /><br />\nCLIMB has five main
      goals: <br />\n- To foster an appreciation for the environment among youth in
      our communities <br />\n- To provide an environment that encourages and supports
      self-discovery and self-awareness <br />\n- To develop critical thinking and
      decision-making skills <br />\n- To teach youth the skills necessary to safely
      experience the natural world while incorporating sustainable practices <br />\n-
      To create an extraordinary opportunity for youth to experience the geographic
      and sociocultural diversity of Morocco\n<br /><br />\nWe will be working alongside
      Moroccan counterparts and community members who will be donating their time
      and expertise to this project. We thank you for helping to provide Moroccan
      youth with a life-changing experience by supporting the successful implementation
      of this program.</p> \n\n\t\t\t<p>If you have questions about this or other

      first few years of school are arguable the most important as this is when the
      basic foundation of academic, social, and life skills are taught and the mastery
      of these skills have a direct impact on their future academic lives and beyond.
      To successfully teach these essential skills each child needs to have access
      to the teacher and a safe environment in which to learn. Although this village
      has a preschool, it is currently over crowded which decreases the ability for
      the teacher to teach effectively and is unsafe due to the high student to teacher
      ratio. A locals recognized these issues with the current preschool that has
      95 students from ages two to five. He began constructing a new school but needs
      help completing this dream of a learning environment for twenty-five female
      students and twenty-five male students. For this facility to be completed there
      needs to be three bathrooms, a kitchen, a fence, a water system and electricity.
      The teacher is also willing to have the new preschool open during the afternoons
      to act as a library and meeting spot for primary school students.</p> \n\n\t\t\t<p>If

      the success of last year''s Camp GLOW, Peace Corps Nicaragua aims to continue
      a sustainable and interactive model for empowering the nation''s young women.
      Camp GLOW will bring together adolescent women from across the country to encourage
      them to work towards creating a society that reflects gender equality.\n<br
      /><br />\nIn Nicaragua, certain cultural factors, such as machismo, prohibit
      women from taking advantage of education and employment opportunities in order
      to fill socially constructed gender roles in the home.  Camp GLOW aspires to
      break these social frameworks by exposing young women to a wealth of opportunity
      and providing tools for creating change in their society. At Camp GLOW, young
      women will attend engaging workshops on topics such as sexual reproductive health,
      gender equality and gender and global human rights, and strategies for future
      planning. The camp will promote leadership skills and encourage the girls to
      return to their communities to implement activities that stimulate gender equality
      amongst their peers. \n<br /><br />\nCamp GLOW will be a four-day event created
      in collaboration with Plan Nicaragua.  Plan has developed the agenda for Camp
      GLOW 2015 based upon their most current campaign: \"Por Ser Nina\".  The campaign
      focuses on overcoming three barriers that have been identified as impeding young
      womens'' development potential; gender based violence, teenage pregnancy, and
      unequal access to opportunities.  Addressing these barriers dovetails very nicely
      with addressing the goals and objectives of Camp Glow 2015. The camp has been
      designed for 60 participants (ages 12-17).  In order to attend the camp, participants
      will have to fill out an application form.  This application form will show
      us each young woman''s interest and motivation to participate in, contribute
      to and take away from the information and experiences offered at camp. Participants
      will be selected based on their compliance with the application deadline and
      their ability to articulate past leadership skills and desire to be future leaders
      in their communities. \n<br /><br />\nCommunities throughout the country have
      pledged support in the form of supplies and snacks, transportation, and most
      notably in human resources. Donations from the Partnership will fund the remaining
      costs of the camp: lodging, meals, and remaining transportation costs.\n</p>

      \"Youth Leadership Camp 2015: Preparing for Tomorrow\" is a four day camp targeted
      at Nicaraguan youth, between ages 16 to 20. The camp consists of an array of
      different educational and recreational activities that focus on the development
      of young leaders and the promotion of active citizenship. This focus is propelled
      by the severe lack of opportunity that faces Nicaraguan today; lack of access
      to primary, secondary and higher level education,  lack of gainful employment
      or promising career paths, as well as a lack of social freedom the inhibits
      interactions between political parties, religions, and even between geographically
      separated groups. This lack of opportunity is felt disproportionately by the
      youth, who represent the largest segment of the population. This impact is further
      highlight by the fact that 68% of Nicaraguan youth identify poverty as a main
      inhibitor to their personal development, which leaves them stagnant and feeling
      disabled to act. This demonstrates the importance of a camp where young leaders
      can come together, learn, interact, and return to their communities to actively
      change the opportunities available to them. The camp will be executed by Peace
      Corps Volunteers in collaboration with a local NGO that is at the forefront
      of youth development and the promotion of active citizenship, for the second
      year in a row. The camp format includes educational sessions, a young professional''s
      panel, central theme to analyze through multiple frames of reference, teamwork
      activities, leadership development, and a planning ahead session to send the
      participants home with the tools to replicate their experience. The educational
      sessions include environmental leadership, professional development, gender
      roles, sexual health, and community resources for advancement. The first objective
      of the camp is that campers will use the learned skills and acquired resources
      to implement projects in their communities, creating opportunities for active
      citizenship and positive change models. The second objective is to connect youth
      leaders throughout the country, encouraging the breakdown of social barriers
      and creating more tolerance for collaboration. The 60 participants, from all
      regions of the country, will be to rely on one another and learn from one another,
      working collectively to triumph the obstacles facing the youth of Nicaragua.</p>

      the school break in January, 2015, Peace Corps Panama volunteers (PCVs) hope
      to have the honor of coordinating a 5-day Ultimate Frisbee and leadership camp
      for 80 under-served youth, ages 8-18, who have potential to be community leaders,
      are dedicated to developing these skills, and are interested in learning more
      about Ultimate Frisbee. Few of the youth have previously traveled so far from
      home or participated in a sports and leadership camp that provides the opportunity
      to form friendships with others from different places and cultures in Panama.
      The PCV facilitators will teach the participants how to play Ultimate Frisbee
      through Ultimate-based games and drills, culminating in a full game. Ultimate
      is the ideal sport through which to encourage youth development because of its
      unique base in the Spirit of the Game (SOTG). SOTG is the concept of mutual
      respect, teamwork, and sportsmanship that is invaluable to Ultimate, as it is
      self-refereed; it defines the integrity and motivation of the players. Additionally,
      PCVs will train participants to be community leaders through workshops on leadership,
      goal setting, decision-making, self-esteem, conflict resolution, and project
      management.</p> \n\n\t\t\t<p>If you have questions about this or other projects,

      Panama struggles to keep up with its rapidly growing economy, critically thinking
      leaders are more essential than ever. It is particularly important for educators
      to be leaders and to be able to pass those critical thinking and leadership
      skills onto their students. Educators need more than traditional methodology
      seminars to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to meet this challenge.
      With this in mind, we have designed a 4-day seminar to give outstanding and
      motivated teachers the opportunity to meet like-minded educators and experience
      leadership development.\n<br /><br />\nThrough the Leadership Development for
      Global Education (LDGE) program, participants will:\n<br />\n-\tDevelop an understanding
      of several aspects of professional and personal leadership, including emotional
      intelligence, identification of strengths, and communication of a vision;\n-\tDefine
      a personal \"vision for positive change\" to be implemented during the 2014
      school year;\n-\tAcquire strategies for implementing their \"vision for positive
      change\" including identification of allies, colleague support, networking,
      and communicating a vision to others.\n-\tBuild a nation-wide network of like-minded
      educators.\nPrevious participants will act as facilitator''s by leading activities
      and discussions about articles and videos and by prompting participants to reflect
      upon and apply personal experiences.\n<br /><br />\nThe requested funds will
      provide lodging, transportation, meals, and supplies for the participants. Our
      facilitators are generously donating their valuable to time to help their colleagues
      have a beneficial experience. \n</p> \n\n\t\t\t<p>If you have questions about

      focus on understanding gender equality and the importance of a healthy lifestyle
      as essential capacities for young men to develop into a good leaders. Our community
      partner organization, will provide a thematic backbone while lectures, guest
      speakers, and activities woven through a variety of sports coordinated by Paraguay
      Peace Corps Volunteers will round out the camp. After returning to their respective
      communities the participants will organize with the volunteer from their area

      This project aims to capacitate youth in digital photography skills. The pictures

      that demonstrates the natural beauty and cultural richness of the area. The
      magazine is to be sold in the provincial capital to encourage tourism. The entire
      project would be made possible through cohesive work with the youth department
      of the municipality, the tourism department of the municipality, and the Peace
      Corps Volunteer.\n<br /><br />\nThe project itself consists of three main stages.
      The first stage is coordinating with the provincial school district to enter
      at least one educational institution in each of the 11 districts of the province.
      Once coordination is satisfactory, three visits will be implemented to each
      selected school. The first two visits will consist of teaching digital photography
      skills to the selected classroom(s). The third visit will be outside of school
      hours wherein the capacitated students will lead a day-long hike around their
      districts and will photograph compelling areas, activities, or people. The second
      stage will include a committee of youth photographers compiling the photographs
      into a document that represents the 11 districts. The document will be edited
      and sent for printing as a magazine of photographs. In the third stage, the
      magazines will be sold to passing national and international tourists in the
      provincial capital. The generated funds will be divided with 60% retained in
      the youth department of the municipality for further photography classes and
      the continuation of the magazine the following year with the remaining 40% being
      used to implement a short-term event benefiting the youth in need throughout
      the province.</p> \n\n\t\t\t<p>If you have questions about this or other projects,

      \"Connecting to the Source\" water project will provide three villages with
      access to tap water, creating six public water taps and reducing the burden
      of fetching water from dirty streams or far distances which is borne by women
      and children.  One of the targeted villages currently has only two water taps
      for 159 families, and in the other village there is one remote water tap for
      114 families-a tap so remote that it is only used by seven households.  Many
      women and children carry water from streams, some contaminated by upstream mining
      activities, or fetch water from far away, even walking an hour and a half or
      two hours per trip.  This project has three goals: first, to connect three villages
      to the main mountain water source and construct six public taps, providing 222
      families with access to tap water, second to build the capacity of the beneficiaries
      to maintain and repair the water infrastructure through the creation of a tap
      committee system and a training program on clean water and tap maintenance,
      and finally to increase the whole community''s ability to properly use water
      sources through a training for community leaders and health workers.  The community
      will contribute substantially to the project, digging the 2,757 meter long canal
      for piping, transporting materials, and contributing monetarily for project
      expenses.  This community has been waiting for years for an opportunity to get
      water in these two villages, and is ready to do whatever it takes to make this
      project happen.  This project could dramatically change the lives of beneficiaries-preventing
      water-related illness like intestinal parasites and diarrhea and reducing the
      heavy time burdens of fetching water from far away, while providing a community
      committee system to ensure that the taps are properly maintained and functioning
      for years to come.</p> \n\n\t\t\t<p>If you have questions about this or other

      of SWAZILAND\\n\\n\\n            For the fourth year, Peace Corps\\\\-Swaziland
      is bringing Camp GLOW \\\\(Girls Leading our World\\\\) to our small African
      Kingdom, however the GLOW team is shaking things up quite a bit. This year we
      will host two five\\\\-day leadership and health camps, where 100 girls, ages
      9\\\\-19 will have the opportunity to address issues that they face daily in
      their communities, such as avoiding teen pregnancy, combating HIV/AIDS and empowering
      other girls to become strong leaders. \\n\\n\\n\\nCamp would not be nearly as
      successful without our dedicated counselors and senior counselors. This year,
      we have a team of 18 senior counselors returning to take part in the training
      and capacity building aspect of camp. Senior counselors will first undergo a
      two\\\\-day training where they will learn important skills such as facilitation,
      lesson planning, and public speaking. They will then work to plan the Training
      of Trainers, where over 60 Swazi women will gain the skills necessary to act
      as counselors at camp and in their clubs.  These women serve as strong role
      models for the girls, and act as club organizers and leaders across Swaziland.
      Thus, GLOW activities serve to not only unite girls nationwide, but also work
      to standardize the curriculum and build partnership across the country.  \\n\\n\\nOnce
      the essential training has taken place, the senior counselors and counselors
      will return to their communities in order to select the girls who will attend
      camp. As stated above, there will be two camps held this year. The first one
      will be geared towards the older girls \\\\(aged 13\\\\-19\\\\), while the second
      one will focus more on disseminating information to younger girls \\\\(aged
      9\\\\-12\\\\). This idea was encouraged by the senior counselors, who mentioned
      a specific need to teach and empower younger girls as a means to foster leadership
      at an earlier age, and encourage the development of positive role models in
      the communities. The two camps are a significant part of this PCPP, and are
      treasured experiences for the girls and counselors who get to participate. Having
      the opportunity to bring young women from across the Kingdom together is invaluable,
      and nurtures empowerment in a way that many other interventions can't, because
      these girls get to share their stories; fears and hopes for the future, and
      begin the process of working to achieve not only their dreams, but those of
      their sisters from all across Swaziland. \\n\\n\\nAdditionally, for the first
      time ever, these leaders will serve on the GLOW committees alongside the Peace
      Corps Volunteers. They are then provided the opportunity to learn book\\\\-keeping,
      budgeting, organizing and planning, and most importantly, have the ability to
      provide advice first\\\\-hand. This is crucial as it opens the door for sustainability,
      ensuring that the communities\xBF needs are expressed and heard. \\n\\n\\nThe
      participating communities will be contributing vast resources and knowledge
      to the project, as well as the time, energy and skills of local facilitators.
      The cost of lodging has been considerably discounted, and use of many facilities
      are being provided for free. Other community and national organizations are
      allowing use of their facilities or services without charge, including a local
      farm, and many quest speakers are providing their own transportation and/or
      waiving presentation fees. \\n\\n\\nGLOW Swaziland is requesting funds from
      PCPP donations for the remaining cost of accommodation, as well as the cost
      of transport for campers, staff, and some local speakers for both our training
      of trainers\xBF workshops for the counselors and camp. We are also requesting
      funds for curriculum printing and a small selection of activity costs. \\n\\n

      is to build a primary school in effort to create easier access to higher education
      for children from a small, rural village and surrounding villages in the northern
      prefecture of Togo. The current Primary School is overrun with students, resulting
      in several classes taking place under trees and in make\\-shift straw huts constructed
      by parents. Consequently, students have a low retention rate and fail to meet
      the educational standards for continuing their education. The community is extremely
      motivated and energized to begin this project and improve the education of their
      children. The community has agreed to contribute roughly a third of the price
      through transportation of material, labor, and purchase of land.\n\nIf you have
